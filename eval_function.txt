Evaluation Function Explanation - Red-Blue Nim
===============================================================

Function Name:
    eval_fn(state, player)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
---------------------------------------------------------------
The evaluation function provides a heuristic estimate of
how favorable a non-terminal state is for the given player.
It is used when the search depth limit is reached in the
Depth-Limited Alpha-Beta version of Minimax.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Logic:
---------------------------------------------------------------
Each game state is represented as a tuple (red, blue, to_move).

    red      = number of red marbles
    blue     = number of blue marbles
    to_move  = the player whose turn it is

The weighted score of the board is computed as:

    value = (2 * red) + (3 * blue)

Rationale:
    - Red marbles are worth 2 points each.
    - Blue marbles are worth 3 points each.
    - A higher total value indicates more marbles remain,
      which is less desirable for the player whose turn it is
      (since they are closer to losing in the standard game).

Thus:

    If to_move == player:
        heuristic = -value
    else:
        heuristic = +value

---------------------------------------------------------------
Interpretation:
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Positive heuristic → favorable for the given player.
- Negative heuristic → unfavorable for the given player.
- The function approximates the true utility when the search
  cannot continue to terminal depth.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Example:
---------------------------------------------------------------
State: (red=3, blue=2, to_move='human')
Player: 'computer'

    value = 2*3 + 3*2 = 12
    Since to_move != player → heuristic = +12

Meaning:
    This is a favorable position for the computer,
    because the human must play next with fewer safe options.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Summary:
---------------------------------------------------------------
This evaluation function reflects the game's scoring system and
strategically favors states where the opponent faces higher
remaining marble counts.

It provides a simple, consistent heuristic for depth-limited
Minimax search to evaluate non-terminal states effectively.
